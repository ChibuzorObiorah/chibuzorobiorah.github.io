                            Born and raised in Nigeria, but now based in New York City area. I've been at Microsoft for 4+ years. Recently got married, 
                            love working out but currently have an obsession with basketball. Dabble in photography.

                        <h3 class="sub-body-header col-2">Some design "principles" I try to live by</h3>
                        <p class="content-p col-2 show-on-scroll">
                            My early experience of design was in Architecture. I got trained to produce high crafted work. We needed to because people dwelled in spaces we would design. Slight error or mistakes could result in major consequences. 
                            Today, people spend most of their time on digital spaces, I belive I owe it to them to design well crafted experiences with the same rigour from my Architecture days.<br><br>
                            Culture is a defining aspect of any organization, espcially creative ones. I care a lot about what kind of culture I am part of and how I can build it properly. Design needs an environment where people enjoy being around each other, so with candor and respect we can elevate one another.<br><br>
                            I believe design should drive meaningful outcomes, and over time, 
                            I’ve developed a deep interest in the business side of things—learning how design fuels growth and how businesses can leverage design as a strategic advantage.<br><br>
                            I don’t just press ‘N’ in Figma to show explorations; I prototype. The best way to communicate ideas is to make them tangible, and I’ve built a reputation for always having a prototype ready to bring concepts to life.<br><br>
                            I have experience building design systems, not just at a product level but in my own workflow—creating components for everything, 
                            from labels to notes, to move faster and work smarter. A strong design system doesn’t just speed up design and development; it makes it easier for others to build on and benefit from the work.<br><br>
                            Good stories makes a difference. No one likes boring presentations. I’ve seen how a compelling narrative can turn a good design into a great one. I’m always looking for ways to weave stories into my work, whether it’s through user journeys, case studies, or even the way I present my work.

                        <h3 class="sub-body-header col-2">About my portfolio</h3>

                            To challenge myself, grow my coding skills, and stand out among the sea of talented designers, 
                            I decided to code my portfolio from scratch. I embarked on this journey using the Human-centered design process. 
                            With my main users being recruiters, design leaders, and hiring managers, I started from research, 
                            learning about my users, to ideation, all the way to what you see now. It was an exciting adventure, but also a rollercoaster ride of frustration 
                            when things didn't go my way. It was stressful too, juggling classes, life as a young adult, and this project. What was I thinking? 
                            But, after all the stress and hair-pulling moments, I got a good working draft! Everything from the logo at the top right corner to the footer has a story.
                            <br><br>
                            The first iteration was created in 2019, while I was in college. These days with AI, I see an opportunity to take it to the next level. New updates coming soon.
