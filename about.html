                            Born and raised in Nigeria, but now based in New York City area building up a church, been at Microsoft since college, recently got married, 
                            love working out but currently have an obsession with basketball - I think I am at my prime, and I fear not seeing my full potential. 
                            Dabble in photography. I'm excited about the AI revolution (hopefully the title gave it away) but that's eveyone these days. Oh yeah, I am a designer, and I have learned a ton in my short career.

                        <h3 class="sub-body-header col-2">Some design "principles" I try to live by</h3>
                        <p class="content-p col-2 show-on-scroll">
                            I believe design should drive meaningful outcomes, and over time, 
                            I’ve developed a deep interest in the business side of things—learning how design fuels growth and how businesses can leverage design as a strategic advantage.<br><br>
                            I don’t just press ‘N’ in Figma to show explorations; I prototype. The best way to communicate ideas is to make them tangible, and I’ve built a reputation for always having a prototype ready to bring concepts to life.<br><br>
                            Accessibility is something I care deeply about, and I hope to become an expert in this space. Sometimes I lose focus, and I am trying to figure out how to make it a big part of my process. <br><br>I have experience building design systems, not just at a product level but in my own workflow—creating components for everything, 
                            from labels to notes, to move faster and work smarter. A strong design system doesn’t just speed up design and development; it makes it easier for others to build on and benefit from the work.<br><br>
                            I don't like boring presentations, and good stories makes a difference. I’ve seen how a compelling narrative can turn a good design into a great one. I’m always looking for ways to weave stories into my work, whether it’s through user journeys, case studies, or even the way I present my work.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="sub-body-header col-2">Why I care about accessibility</h3>
                        <p class="content-p col-2 show-on-scroll">
                            After a fireworks mishap left me with vision in only one eye, I quickly noticed the little challenges that came with it. 
                            Some were minor and easy to work around, but it got me thinking about what life is like for someone who is fully visually impaired. 
                            This opened my eyes (pun intended) to the broader world of disabilities. 
                            I began to see how inaccessible many things are and how design can really impact how people get around. 
                            It made me realize just how powerful good design can be. Too often, accessibility is an afterthought in the design process, and I am growing to make it a forethought.

                        <h3 class="sub-body-header col-2">About my portfolio</h3>
                        <p class="content-p col-2 show-on-scroll">
                            To challenge myself, grow my coding skills, and stand out among the sea of talented designers, 
                            I decided to code my portfolio from scratch. I embarked on this journey using the Human-centered design process. 
                            With my main users being recruiters, design leaders, and hiring managers, I started from research, 
                            learning about my users, to ideation, all the way to what you see now. It was an exciting adventure, but also a rollercoaster ride of frustration 
                            when things didn't go my way. It was stressful too, juggling classes, life as a young adult, and this project. What was I thinking? 
                            But, after all the stress and hair-pulling moments, I finally finished! Everything from the logo at the top right corner to the footer has a story;

                            The first iteration was created in 2019, while I was in college. These days with AI, I see an opportunity to take it to the next level. It's going to keep changing.
