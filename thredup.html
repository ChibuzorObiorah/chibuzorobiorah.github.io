                            <p>The world's largest fashion resale marketplace, ThredUP, is a fashion e-commerce platform focused on secondhand clothing.
                                As a product design intern, I got to work with the product team, focusing on their native app.  
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I worked on three different projects, and got to help the team out in different ways, but my main project was improving 
                                the checkout experience on the native mobile app, which is what this case study is about.

                        <p class="problem-body">On the thredUp native app, there was a 68% drop-off rate from the cart page to the checkout page, and even a 20% more drop-off rate 
                            from the checkout page to users placing an order. 
                            <br> 
                            <br>
                            Since the checkout funnel is an important part of the thredUp business, we wanted to see if we could reduce the drop-off rate.

                    <h2 class="main-body-header col-2">Research</h2>
                    <p class="content-p col-2">
                        To tackle this problem, I conducted some secondary research, reading through a bunch of <a href="www.google.com" class="content-link">articles</a> to understand what makes a good checkout experience, 
                        and what made it stand out. One of the things that stood out right to me was:
                    </p>
                    <p class="emphasize">
                        69.23% of all e-commerce visitors abandon their shopping carts
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-p col-2">
                        So I started to dig deeper to find some of the reasons why people abandoned their carts. Thankfully, some of these existing research was very impactful 
                        in the new designs I created.

                    <p class="content-p col-2">
                        There were a lot of insights and lessons about designing an awesome checkout experience with examples in mind, but I narrowed them down to things that related 
                        more with the thredUP's native app. Here are my top takeaways:

                    <p class="less-emphasize">
                        People want to see the checkout flow, the steps, progress, and different leaps involved, way ahead of time.

                    <p class="less-emphasize">
                        A Good Checkout flow is transparent, showing all things users need to know, like the extra cost.
                    </p>
                    <p class="less-emphasize">
                        Reducing any frustrations, making it simple, and intuitive reduces friction and helps users go through the checkout flow quicker.
                    </p>
                    <p class="less-emphasize">
                        Providing users with options, and helping them through out the checkout flow, propels them faster to the end-goal.

                        In order to construct a concise and solid foundation for ThredUP's checkout flow, I ventured to see out to see what the other 
                        e-commerce platforms were doing well in their checkout process.

                        After research, I brainstormed ideas to improve the checkout experience, including new features like the ability to scan credit card, offering guest checkout, 
                        inline validation for credit cards, e.t.c.

                        Before moving on, I wanted to get a feel for what the new checkout flow could be. I was exploring between 
                        having all the steps displayed in one page and the steps laid out on a half-sheet.
                    </p>

                    <p class="content-p col-2">
                        When I started working on the High-Fidelity mockups for this designs, I created three different iterations highlighting how I wanted the new checkout flow to be. 
                        One of the major feedback I received was to think about users that had never purchased items at thredUP and users who had purchased before and how their experience 
                        might be different. We realized that the half-sheet does not do a good job of directing new users, and the third one had a nice step by step direction for new users

                        While working on this project, ThredUP was going through a rebrand process, so I moved on to the new rebrand design system, addressing the feedback I 
                        received, adding to the design I created, and ended up with two final iterations.

                        To make the Checkout flow accomplish our goal I had to think through all the interactions going on in the checkout flow, from inline validations to what happens when they click the buttons. 
                        I made a prototype to visualize show all the interactions.

                            I found a great oppurtunity here to add elements of the rebrand, giving users an exciting confirmation notice when they place their 
                            order and gives them option to keep navigating through the app.

                        Working on this project, I realized the potential it has. If more people find out about it, i'm sure it'll be helpful and it could expand beyond San Francisco. 
                        I wish I had more time to re-iterate and user test my design but I had to hand off my new design back to Zendesk, where I hope they continue to improve on it.

                            <strong>Design needs to co-operate with business</strong> 
                            <br>
                            One of the biggest challenges I faced was working on the payment method because of all the things I had to consider which includes some business 
                            considerations from ThredUP and the companies from the payment methods. I had to make a design that satisfied all of the guidelines. 
                            It was challenging but I was able to come to a final solution satisfying all the constraints.

                            <strong>Data empowers design</strong> 
                            <br>
                            This project came about because of the data showing what was going on in the checkout flow. We always want 
                            to create impactful products and at first glance it's hard to come to a conclusion on what needs to improved or changed, but looking at data 
                            helps us. They aren't just numbers, they inform us on how our users use our product. I wish I had more time to test the designs 
                            I created, but it's on ThredUP's roadmap and they will be testing it out before rolling the designs to the public.
